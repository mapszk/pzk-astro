            Kimple is a educational platform that provides contents, resources and materials with topical projects to all the teachers and institutions. At Kimple I'm in charge of resolving issues, delivering new features and I was also part of many developed projects, one of the biggest was Kimple Krea, a brand new tool provided to the schools for the content creation

            I accomplished the creation of a tool integrated with multiple libraries to give the user the best experience, with tooltips, text editors, progress bars, auto-saving and different types of inputs.

            We also worked on a new feed to render the content with suggestions depending on user activity and popularity of content, integrated with a new search bar synchronized with browser URL to share the results across the devices.
